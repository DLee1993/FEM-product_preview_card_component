## Overview

The challenge is building out a Product preview component and getting it as close to the design as possible. For this challenge I attempted to use Tailwindcss for the first time.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

For this challenge my process was fairly straight forward, I initially split the challenge into two parts, the product image section and the product description section. Firstly I styled the responsive layout for the overall component using flexbox, that takes care of the mobile and desktop layout, for this challenge the layout is straight forward as the only pieces of the component that change layout are the results and summary sections, all other text stays the same. I then added and styled the jsx for the product description section of the component. There was no need to styl the image as it fills the entire section.

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   Tailwindcss
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

For this challenge my main focus point of learning was tailwindcss, this challenge gave me the opportunity to start understanding how to use utility classes with responsive design in mind.

### Continued development

I am going to continue to use tailwind to grow and develop my understanding. I also aim to better my understanding of react best practices

### Useful resources

-   Tailwindcss Docs (https://www.tailwindcss.com) - This helped me understand how to implement gradients and boxshadows with utility classes
